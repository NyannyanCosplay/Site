      <h3> A recap of everything that happened in the discord servers made around NyanNyanCosplay</h3>
      <p>
        It all started with the Church of Nyannyan (now Almost Heaven). A discord server made by a few fans and the first community built around Kat.
        <br> Eventually it gained momentum as one of the admins posted an invite link in the description of a popular youtube video of Kat.
        <br> Later Kat's friend would join the server and talk to the people in the server.
        The server was becoming a stronger community at this point and was still going strong. <br> Kat's friend got the power to moderate the server so he could ban things
        that Kat didn't like to be associated with her, like the tekashi69 edit of Kat. <br> The people that were banned made a new server called
        The Reformed Church. They were known to not like Kat's friend because he banned them and <br> couldn't get back into the Church.
        Kat joined the server shortly after this ban wave because she felt safe joining the server and wanted to be more involved with her community.
        <br> <br> After Kat had joined The Reformed Church didn't like Kat's friend because he banned them. Kat herself was more relaxed about things than her friend,
        and later <br> he got his moderator status removed because of a misunderstanding where members of The Church thought he was banning
        a lot of other members by himself <br> but it was multiple people banning a lot of members from the The Church.
        Kat was communicating with her community and they were building a stronger relationship with each other. <br> This was the golden age of the
        NyanNyanCosplay discord servers, everyone was becoming closer and closer with eachother.
        <br> Eventually Kat's friend left the server since some of the people from the Reformed Church that he banned joined back into the Church.
        <br> Alphern would make a new server called The Fanclub around the same time the Church was created, and a few close friends joined.
        <br> Kat's friend would later also join and see if it was okay for Kat to join. He would also inform to Kat that most of
        the Church was starting to lose interest in her <br> and that they were becoming trollers and doxxers.
        Eventually Kat would stop coming into the Church because she was dealing with personal issues and <br> needed some time away from the drama.
        Luckily she was getting support from her friends in The Church wich helped her get through stuff.
        <br> Kat wanted to start fresh by making a new server called "NyanNyanofficial" but
        she had to close the server after one day since she unfortunatley <br> didn't predict that it would influence her personal life to that degree.
        So at this point the members of the Church are understandably angry with Kat <br> for leaving the
        Church after everything that had happened and mostly being in the Official server.
        This unfortunatley hurt the community in ways that they didn't expect.
        <br> Mrs. Fahrenheit (the owner of the Church) tried to delete the server for Kat because of the new Official server. But instead she only deleted all
        the text channels, <br> and last_in_space convinced her to give him ownership of the Church.
        This is why the Church - Almost Heaven - Blue Hearts, <br> seem to have so much pent up feeling about
        the mods and admins and even Kat herself. <br> <br> The Official server was dying since it wasn't receiving any new members and
        Kat couldnt talk much in official since she was still dealing with her own personal life. <br> Fanclub was at this time not being used
        anymore and was later deleted because it was being misunderstood and upset a lot of people that Kat was more in the <br> Fanclub instead of the Church.
        Jaylan later tried to join the Fanclub a few times because he was trusted enough to join but he misunderstood
        the Fanclub for a moderator server. <br> He got angry with the Fanclub so he tried to massban official for revenge
        but he got baited in to trying by the other admins and they stopped him before he could do anything.
        <br> Official was as good as dead at this point, luckily Suzuki (an admin on the Official server) made a new server called NyanNyanCentral.
        <br> If it wasn't for Suzuki and NNC, the community probably would have died off.
        Around three weeks later someone leaked screenshots <br> of a private server called Pulp Fiction Gang where a few members in NNC were seen hating
        on Kat's friend. <br> The members were stripped of their powers and banned from the server.
        Around Kat’s birthday NNC made a birthday edit where a lot of members were singing songs <br> and making sick edits for her. She thought it was so nice that she
        personally wanted to thank everyone in NNC. <br> She later joined NNC and talked with the members in them. Kat still tries to be more involved with
        her community <br> so she still sometimes join chat and talks with some of the members in there.

        Tsar joined around 22 november when he joined the Official server. He became good friends with the admins since he is a
        fun guy to talk to and doesn’t go too crazy when Kat joins chat. Since he was regularly talking with everyone,
        the admins offered him to also become an admin. He refused a few times but he later accepted it and joined the admin team.
        Tsar is one of the more laid back admins, he is usually there to talk with people and just socialize with them,
        all around he is here to have a good time. He also has an amazing reading voice so watch out when he joins voice chat.
