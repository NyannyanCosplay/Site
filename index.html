      <p>
        Suzuki joined around 6 november when he joined this community. He started as most of us did, a reddit lurker and
        that’s also how he first joined Almost Heaven/The Church (the discord server before official).
        He joined official when it first opened but after the server wasn’t doing so well. Since Suzuki
        already had a lot of experience managing discords servers he made a new server called NyanNyanCentral
        which fixed almost all of the problems official had. After NNC became successful he got closer with the other
        admins of Official and was helping official fix some of the problems it had. Many say he saved the community by
        making NNC after official had some serious issues. In my opinion he definitely saved this community by making official.

      <p>
        Fem joined very early on, around 14 october when he joined the Fanclub (a discord server made by a few close friends revolved around Kat). He already knew Neo since they were friends with each other for about 3 years. He also joined The Church (an open discord server revolved around Kat) but he wasn’t very active in there since he mostly talked in the Fanclub. After a while he became friends with Kat and was helping moderate the the Official server. He also expresses himself creatively on his twitter in a very exaggerating and humouristic manner. <a href="https://twitter.com/femlmao ">@femlmao</a>

      <header>Tsar William, the laid back admin</header>
      <img src="content/profilepics/tsar.jpg" alt="tsar" class="profilepic">
      <p>
        Tsar joined around 22 november when he joined the Official server. He became good friends with the admins since he is a
        fun guy to talk to and doesn’t go too crazy when Kat joins chat. Since he was regularly talking with everyone,
        the admins offered him to also become an admin. He refused a few times but he later accepted it and joined the admin team.
        Tsar is one of the more laid back admins, he is usually there to talk with people and just socialize with them,
        all around he is here to have a good time. He also has an amazing reading voice so watch out when he joins voice chat.
