	<div align="left"><h3> The History of NyanNyanCosplay Discord Servers</h3>
		<p> It all started with the Church of Nyannyan (now Almost Heaven).
			<span style="display:block; height: 1;"></span>
			Eventually Kat would stop coming into the Church because she was dealing with personal issues and was talking a lot in the Fanclub to get support from her close friends.
			Kat wanted to start fresh by making a new server called "NyanNyanOfficial" but unfortunately she had to close the server after one day because of personnal reasons.
			So at this point the members of the Church are understandably angry with Kat for leaving the Church after everything happened. She unfortunatley hurt the community by closing official but again she had to deal with personal issues and couldnt keep it open. Mrs. Fahrenheit (the owner of the Church) tried to delete the server for Kat because of the new one. This is why the Church - Almost Heaven - Blue Hearts, seem to have so much pent up feeling about the mods and admins and even Kat herself. The Church's community was rescued by last_in_space, but The Official server was dead. Kat couldnt talk much in official because again she had to deal with personal issues. Fanclub was at this time not being used anymore and was later deleted because it was being misunderstood and upset that Kat was more in the Fanclub instead of the Church. Jaylan later tried to join the Fanclub a few times because he thought he was trusted enough to join but he misunderstood the Fanclub for a moderator server. He got angry with the Fanclub so he tried to massban official for revenge but he got baited in to trying by the other mods and admins stopped him before he could do anything. If it wasn't for Suzuki and NNC, the community probably would have died off. <br>
			Someone leaked screenshots of a private server called Pulp Fiction Gang where prussian was seen hating on a friend of kat, prussian was stripped of his powers and banned after it became known.
			For Katâ€™s birthday NNC made a birthday edit and she thought it was so nice that she personally wanted to thank everyone in NNC so she joined the server and did just that. She sometimes joins voicechat and talks in chat because she does try to be more involved with the community even though she is dealing with personal stuff.
