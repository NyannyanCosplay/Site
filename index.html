		   <p>
        <img src="content/img12.png" alt="img" align="middle">

        It all started with the Church of Nyannyan (now Almost Heaven). A server made by a few fans and the first community built around Kat.
        Eventually it gained momentum as one of the admins posted the link in the description of a popular youtube video of Kat.
        Later Kat's friend would join the server and talk to the people in the server.
        The server was becoming a stronger community at this point. Kat's friend got the power to moderate the server so he could ban things
        that Kat didn't like to be associated with her, like the tekashi69 edit of Kat. The people that were banned made a new server called
        The Reformed Church. They were known to not like Kat's friend because he banned them and couldn't get back into the Church.
        Kat joined the server shortly after this ban wave because she felt safe and wanted to be more involved with her community.
        After Kat had joined The Reformed Church didn't like Kat's friend because he banned them. Kat herself was more relaxed about things than her friend,
        and later he got his moderator status removed because of a misunderstanding where members of The Church thought he was banning
        a lot of other members by himself but it was multiple people banning a lot of members from the The Church.
        Kat was communicating with her community and they were building a stronger relationship with each other. This was the golden age of the
        NyanNyanCosplay discord servers, everyone was becoming closer and closer with eachother.
        Eventually Kat's friend left the server since some of the people from the Reformed Church that he banned joined back into the Church.
        Alphern made a new server called the Fanclub around the same time the Church was created, and a few close friends joined.
        Kat's friend would later also join and see if it was okay for Kat to join. He would also inform Kat that most of
        the Church were starting to lose interest in her and that they were becoming trolls and doxxers.
        Eventually Kat would stop coming into the Church because she was dealing with
        personal issues and was talking a lot in the Fanclub to get support from her close friends.
        Kat wanted to start fresh by making a new server called "NyanNyanofficial" but unfortunately
        she had to close the server after one day because of personnal reasons.
        So at this point the members of the Church are understandably angry with Kat for leaving the
        Church after everything happened. She unfortunatley hurt the community by closing official but again she had to deal with
        personal issues and couldnt keep it open. Mrs. Fahrenheit (the owner of the Church) tried to delete the server for
        Kat because of the new one. This is why the Church - Almost Heaven - Blue Hearts, seem to have so much pent up feeling about
        the mods and admins and even Kat herself. The Church's community was rescued by last_in_space, but The Official server was dead.
        Kat couldnt talk much in official because again she had to deal with personal issues. Fanclub was at this time not being used
        anymore and was later deleted because it was being misunderstood and upset that Kat was more in the Fanclub instead of the Church.
        Jaylan later tried to join the Fanclub a few times because he thought he was trusted enough to join but he misunderstood
        the Fanclub for a moderator server. He got angry with the Fanclub so he tried to massban official for revenge
        but he got baited in to trying by the other mods and admins stopped him before he could do anything.
        If it wasn't for Suzuki and NNC, the community probably would have died off.
        Someone leaked screenshots of a private server called Pulp Fiction Gang where prussian was seen hating on a friend of kat,
        prussian was stripped of his powers and banned after it became known.
        For Katâ€™s birthday NNC made a birthday edit and she thought it was so nice that she personally wanted to thank everyone
        in NNC so she joined the server and did just that. She sometimes joins voicechat and talks in chat because she does try to be more involved with
        the community even though she is dealing with personal stuff.
